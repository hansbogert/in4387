Project for in4387 @TUDelft '13-'14

The intent of this project is to model a (traffic) bridge which can be lifted to let ships sail through when the bridge is in an upward position.

The modelling is done using [MCRL2](http://www.mcrl2.org/release/user_manual/index.html). MCRL2 uses the [modal-mu-calculus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_%CE%BC-calculus) as its process modeling language
